        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          	Hello! I am a Senior lecturer at the Centre for Astrophysics Research, University of Hertfordshire, UK. I am generally interested in studying the formation and evolution of galaxies, particularly how supermassive black holes
		in the centre of galaxies affect the evolution. Specific topics include tracing and characterising multi-scale and multi-phase outflows, calculating outflow kinetic energy and coupling efficiencies, determining molecular gas 
		content in star forming and AGN host galaxies and investigating the impact of outflows on star formation rates. I use a combination of imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy to study the nuclear and extended regions in 
		nearby (low-redshift) and distant (high-redshift, including Cosmic Noon). I have extensively used data from both ground-based and space telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Very Large Telescope (VLT) and 
		Atacama Large Millimetre-sub-mm Array (ALMA) in Chile, Keck in Hawaii (US) and Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFes) at ANU 2.3m telescope. I am an active member of several large international collaborations such as GOALS, SUPER, BASS, 
		4MOST-CHANGES, COSMOS-Web, COSMOS-3D, WST and S7.
	</p>
	<p>
		I obtained my Bachelors and Masters degree in Physics from University of Delhi and Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, respectively. Thereafter, I did my PhD in Astrophysics from Ludwig Maximilian University, whilst working at
		the European Southern Observatory in Garching (Munich, Germany). After my PhD, I was an ESO-fellow at the European Southern Observatory (Chile) and University of Oxford (UK) between 2017-2021 and a Prize fellow at the Space Telescope 
		Science Institute in Baltimore (US). Thereafter, I was a CAR fellow at University of Hertfordshire (UK), before moving to a faculty position at Hertfordshire in early 2025. 
	</p>
	<p>	
		During my fellowships at ESO and STScI, I also supported the operations of ground-based and space telescopes for 50% of my time, particularly the MUSE-IFU intrument and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (FUV). I have also led technical 
		SPIE papers as a part of the HARMONI and COS instrument teams, which includes I development of new sky-subtraction methods for upcoming IFS instruments on board Extremely Large Telescopes and exploring new lifetime positions on COS FUV
		spectrograph.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the field of astronomy, we generate a large amount of data that is gathered from state-of-the-art telescopes and/or simulations that model different astrophysical phenomena. As a result of the data intensive nature of projects,
		Astronomers develop key skills useful in the field of data science and quantitative analysis. As a faculty member, I also teach students enrolled in M.Sc. Data Science several aspects about how to do projects. These projects are
		highly diverse and range from predicting stock market price movements, evaluating credit default or insurance fraud probabilities, novel methods to visualise large data etc, using machine learning techniques.

        <p>The primary goal of my research projects is to search for direct or indirect evidence of how supermassive black holes affect the evolution of their host galaxies. I have been using data from telescopes such as VLT, Keck, JWST, ALMA to trace gas in multiple phases.</p>

	<p><b>Discovery of the closest separation dual AGN in UGC 4211:</b> Using multi-wavelength high resolution observations with state-of-the-art instrumentation, such as VLT/MUSE, ALMA, Keck/OSIRIS and HST, we find two AGN at a projected separation of ~230 pc, closest separation known yet for a black hole pair. Here's the <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...942L..24K/abstract">link</a> to the paper. </p>

	<p><b>MUSE-AO observations of the Circinus galaxy:</b> A "tuning-fork" outflow morphology in the Circinus galaxy as observed by the Adaptive Optics assisted MUSE instrument on board the VLT. Presented in <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.519.5324K/abstract">Kakkad et al. (2023)</a>, this structure remained undetected in previous low resolution observations.</p>

	<p><b>Spatially-resolved outflows using Integral Field Spectrographs:</b> I have led and am involved in several projects that map the distribution of ionised gas in galaxies and characterise outflows associated with them. My future work focuses on gathering a holistic picture of outflows by using multi-wavelength observations from telescopes such as JWST, ALMA, VLT and JVLA that will target multiple gas phases. This work is done in collaboration with several international teams such as <a>BASS</a>, <a>GOALS</a>, <a>SUPER</a>, <a>S7</a> and <a>QFeedS</a> (a non-exhaustive list). Check out <a>Kakkad et al.

PSF-subtraction in IFS data

For seeing-limited Integral Field Spectroscopic observations of AGN host galaxies at high redshift, it is extremely important to take into account beam smearing effects due to the AGN point spread function (PSF). Using the emission from Broad Line Region (BLR) as an estimate for the PSF, I performed the PSF-subtraction in near-infrared IFS observations of z=2 AGN host galaxies. I found that nearly 50% of the observed [OIII] emission is not extended. Further details of this procedure can be found in Kakkad et al. (2020).

Resolved BPT maps

One of the best things about Integral Field Spectroscopy is its capability to produce such diagnostic diagrams to map the source of ionisation in galaxies. The plot on the left shows a BPT diagram which divides the parameter space into regions ionised by star formation, AGN and composite processes. Each data point corresponds to a pixel in the map on the right. The magenta contours show the location of the HII regions, which are coincident with the blue regions indicative of ionisation by star formation. Further details in Kakkad et al. (2018).

Electron densities in AGN host galaxies

Electron density values are highly useful in determining key outflow parameters such as mass outflow rates. The map here shows the electron density distribution in a low redshift galaxy derived from the [SII]6716,6731 doublet. The magenta contours are the sites of HII emission (star formation) and the orange contour show the location of the AGN ionisation cone. Star forming regions show an enhancement in the electron density values. Similar maps were derived for the outflowing media, which can be found in Kakkad et al. (2018).


Molecular gas content in high-z galaxies

Ever wondered what the molecular gas fractions of AGN host galaxies compare with non AGN host galaxies? Kakkad et al. (2017) provides an answer, at least for galaxies at the Cosmic noon (z = 2). AGN host galaxies (coloured symbols and lines in this plot) consistently show low molecular gas fractions when compared with normal star forming galaxies.

Outflow-AGN scaling relations

Outflow properties, namely velocity, mass outflow rates and kinetic energy show strong correlations with the bolometric luminosity of the AGN. In Kakkad et al. (2022), I derived spatially resolved mass outflow rates, eliminating the need for assumptions in outflow models that resulted in systematic uncertainties of multiple orders of magnitude. The result: Correlations of outflow properties exist with bolometric luminosity, but are weak with black hole mass and Eddington ratios. 

Up next

The recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already proved its capability in detecting galaxies at some of the highest redshifts observed to date. It's IFU capabilities will provide unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity to conduct kinematic analysis of galaxies up to high redshifts. Watch this page for new JWST results on gas kinematics at cosmic noon in the upcoming months. Image Credit: NASA

An integral field spectrograph operating in the optical wavelengths, the MUSE instrument on board the Very Large Telescope is one of the most subscribed instruments at the observatory. I am the PI of two MUSE programmes for which the observations will start in 2022-2023. Stay tuned for new results. Image credit: ESO

The Atacama Large Millimetre-submillimetre Array (ALMA) is a state-of-the-art interferometric facility in the Atacama Desert in Chile. Located at a height of about 5000 m, the facility has provided insights into the molecular gas and dust composition of nearby and distant galaxies. Exciting new results will be coming up on molecular gas observations of extragalactic sources in the next month, so stay tuned. Image credit: ALMA

4MOST is a next-generation fibre-fed spectroscopic facility operated by the European Southern Observatory. The survey will provide millions of galaxy spectra in the second half of 2020s and will tackle some of the fundamental questions on galaxy evolution and AGN feedback. I am a member of the 4MOST community survey, CHANGES (PI: F. Bauer) that will target variability-selected AGN from existing and planned surveys. Full science operations of 4MOST are expected to start in 2024.
