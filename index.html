        <h1>News: PhD position on black holes at University of Hertfordshire</h1>
        <p>Applications for PhD positions are open to work with me at the University of Hertfordshire on demographic studies of black holes across cosmic time. Further details are given below: </p>
		<p><i>
		Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing at the centres of most galaxies play a pivotal role in regulating star formation within their hosts. This process, known as Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)
		feedback, operates via powerful winds and outflows launched from the black hole’s accretion disk and/or collimated jets observed in the radio. These winds can either expel the cold molecular gas 
		that fuels star formation or heat it sufficiently to prevent stars from forming. AGN feedback has become a key ingredient in several cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that model galaxy formation 
		and evolution.</i>
		</p>
		<p><i>
		Despite decades of observations of galaxies hosting AGN, the physical details of this feedback process remain poorly understood. We are still far from establishing a comprehensive picture of how black 
		holes influence their host galaxies across the broader galaxy population. This is particularly true for galaxies hosting low-mass black holes or black holes with low mass accretion rates, which are 
		thought to have been the dominant population throughout much of cosmic history.</i>
		</p>
		<p><i>
		In the 2020s and 2030s, large-scale statistical spectroscopic surveys of AGN host galaxies will provide unprecedented opportunities to explore these questions. 
		This PhD project will utilise state-of-the-art spectroscopic data from the 4MOST CHANGES community survey (Bauer et al. 2023). 4MOST is the largest spectroscopic facility in the Southern Hemisphere 
		and you will become part of a diverse international collaboration working to detect fast accretion-disk winds and to characterise the interstellar medium of AGN host galaxies (stellar age, metallicity) 
		and their connection to black hole mass and luminosity. You will also integrate these observations with data from publicly available spectroscopic surveys to build a more complete statistical framework.</i>
		</p>
		<p><i>
		Beyond its scientific goals, this project also offers extensive opportunities to develop interdisciplinary expertise in data science, data management, and machine learning, given the statistical nature of the datasets.</i>

    <!-- About Me Section -->
    <section id="about" class="container">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
        Hello! I am a Senior lecturer at the Centre for Astrophysics Research, University of Hertfordshire, UK. I am generally interested in studying the formation and evolution of galaxies, particularly how supermassive black holes
	in the centre of galaxies affect the evolution. Specific topics include tracing and characterising multi-scale and multi-phase outflows, calculating outflow kinetic energy and coupling efficiencies, determining molecular gas 
	content in star forming and AGN host galaxies and investigating the impact of outflows on star formation rates. I use a combination of imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy to study the nuclear and extended regions in 
	nearby (low-redshift) and distant (high-redshift, including Cosmic Noon). I have extensively used data from both ground-based and space telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Very Large Telescope (VLT) and 
	Atacama Large Millimetre-sub-mm Array (ALMA) in Chile, Keck in Hawaii (US) and Wide-Field Spectrograph (WiFes) at ANU 2.3m telescope. I am an active member of several large international collaborations such as GOALS, SUPER, BASS, 
	4MOST-CHANGES, COSMOS-Web, COSMOS-3D, WST and S7.
	</p>
	<p>
	I obtained my Bachelors and Masters degree in Physics from University of Delhi and Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, respectively. Thereafter, I did my PhD in Astrophysics from Ludwig Maximilian University, whilst working at
	the European Southern Observatory in Garching (Munich, Germany). After my PhD, I was an ESO-fellow at the European Southern Observatory (Chile) and University of Oxford (UK) between 2017-2021 and a Prize fellow at the Space Telescope 
	Science Institute in Baltimore (US). Thereafter, I was a CAR fellow at University of Hertfordshire (UK), before moving to a faculty position at Hertfordshire in early 2025. 
	</p>
	<p>	
	During my fellowships at ESO and STScI, I also supported the operations of ground-based and space telescopes for 50% of my time, particularly the MUSE-IFU intrument and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (FUV). I have also led technical 
	SPIE papers as a part of the HARMONI and COS instrument teams, which includes I development of new sky-subtraction methods for upcoming IFS instruments on board Extremely Large Telescopes and exploring new lifetime positions on COS FUV
	spectrograph.
	</p>
	<p>
	In the field of astronomy, we generate a large amount of data that is gathered from state-of-the-art telescopes and/or simulations that model different astrophysical phenomena. As a result of the data intensive nature of projects,
	Astronomers develop key skills useful in the field of data science and quantitative analysis. As a faculty member, I also teach students enrolled in M.Sc. Data Science several aspects about how to do projects. These projects are
	highly diverse and range from predicting stock market price movements, evaluating credit default or insurance fraud probabilities, novel methods to visualise large data etc, using machine learning techniques.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
	I am an observational astronomer studying the formation and evolution of galaxies, with a particular focus on the role of supermassive black holes in shaping this process through Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback. 
	My research combines imaging and spectroscopic observations from both ground-based and space-based telescopes, targeting galaxies across a wide range of redshifts. 
	I then compare these observations with semi-empirical models and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to better understand the underlying physical mechanisms.
	<br>
	I am also an active member of several international collaborations, including <a href="https://bass-survey.com/">BASS</a>, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020A%26A...642A.147K/abstract">SUPER</a>,

	</p>

	<ul>
	<li>Multi-phase outflows in galaxies</li>
	<li>Molecular gas in AGN and star forming galaxies</li>
	<li>Metallicity studies of AGN and star forming galaxies</li>
